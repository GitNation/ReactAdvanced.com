						<p class="ws-desc__p">Investing just 8 hours into your employees’ development can result in a sufficient performance improvement. Let’s say, 10 of you engineers attend a full- day workshop. In the next year, they will put in approximately 20,000 hours of work for your company. If after the workshop their performance improves by only 1%, your organization in return will gain 200 hours of work. Impressive outcome after one training day only!</p>
