We’ll start in 2005, when academia researchers first started exploring the idea of adding a strongly typed system on top of JavaScript. We’ll walk through the complications at hand (with plenty of examples), and understand the design goals of both TypeScript and Flow. After understanding the state of the art, we’ll briefly go over what’s going to change in this space over the next few years.'

This talk will explore how we were able to make a client’s React codebase more readable and improve communication and productivity on their team by leveraging technologies like TypeScript, GraphQL, and React hooks in a rewrite of their website. Increase the speed at which new developers are able to onboard to your project, cut down on the time between when a PR is submitted and when it’s merged, and streamline the bug squashing process.'

See real cases and design flawless that can make the development too difficult, and learn about good practices to create a real accessible app for everyone.'

		speaker: 'Monica Wojciechowska',
		desc: 'From a quick glance, it might not seem like D3 and React are a match made in heaven. After all, they’re both all about being in charge - who gets to render, who gets to update, who gets to decide how things should look... the story goes on and on. But with these two, as in life, the best relationship is about compromise and sharing responsibilities. So, how can we turn a tug-of-war into a beautiful, responsive, animated tango? Enter, React hooks!'

		title: 'Build your own Native Module',
		speaker: 'Patrick Loureiro',
		desc: 'Sometimes an app needs to access a platform API and React Native doesn’t have a corresponding module yet. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions. In this talk you will learn how to do that and see a real-world example.'

		speaker: 'Olga Petrova',
		desc: '<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">Tensorflow.js</a> brought Machine Learning to Javascript that gives a wide range of possibilities. Now it is possible to build, train and use ML models directly in browser. But the efficiency of ML model highly depends on the features that it is using. React allows to reinforce ML feature engineering process. It is great for displaying fast-changing data in web and let to visualize features, model’s layers and weights in a run-time during model training that gives useful insides on how features correspond to the result, what are good features and what features could be removed. During the session we will use React-based model visualization to pick the best features to predict results of soccer matches played at the FIFA World Cups. We will check count of matches that team have won and lost, count of wins and loses against a particular competitor, goal differences, stage, etc. We will validate our model using matches results from the last Mundial in Russia in 2018.'

		speaker: 'Lorenzo Sciandra',
		desc: 'React Native is now 4 years old. During this time, we’ve observed more progression than ever before towards the vision of a cross-platform mobile solution. Even still, we have yet to realise its core mission of being as powerful as pure native. There have been many challenges that we’ve faced head on as they’ve surfaced. In overcoming them with the support of the community, we’ve managed to establish React Native as a force that is now defining the future of the segment.<br/>
		In this talk, we’ll explore this history-in-the-making before diving deeper into more technical subjects including the JSI & JSC upgrade, TurboModules & Fabric, and the CodeGen. With all the pieces of the puzzle in place and landing on master by end of the year, we are closer to reaching our original objective than ever before - while pushing the limits to a whole new level.'
