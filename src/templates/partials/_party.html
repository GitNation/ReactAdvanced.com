									SMOOSH is coming to React Advanced with their next iteration of a JavaScript comedy night, bringing some of the greatest experts of developer humour on stage to make you laugh and cry.<br/>
									It's a meetup. It's a standup. It's a musical. It's a play. You can even get on stage and battle in an epic game of BattleDecks.

									An electronic music and audiovisual group from London, established by producer Jack Driscoll and visual artist Alex Kempton in 2016. The visuals in their show have been created entirely in Javascript using WebGL. Polyop have developed a spectacular audiovisual show set in an alternate universe. The show follows a mysterious demi-god across the polyhedral-plane, inhabited by strange planets, entities and nomad aliens, to the sound of 90’s techno breakbeat and acid performed live on hardware synthesisers and drum machines.
