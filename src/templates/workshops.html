									Writing applications with React is awesome. But sometimes creating reusable components can be a bit of a trick. And knowing the right level of abstraction and what libraries to use can be frustratingly difficult. Luckily for us, React is constantly getting better. Making React components that can be used in multiple places is not hard. What is hard is when the use cases differ. Without the right patterns, you can find yourself with a highly complex component that requires a lot of configuration props and way too many if statements. With this course, you'll not only learn great patterns you can use, but also the strengths and weaknesses of each so you know which to reach for to provide your components the flexibility and power you need. We'll also take a look at how to use React's built-in state management capabilities to solve common problems for production applications in elegant and simple ways. 
									I have contributed to and published some of the most successful React components in the React ecosystem. Through that experience, I've learned and taught patterns that enhance flexibility, usefulness, and simplicity. I've taught thousands of developers how to be more effective with React. Join us!

									The JavaScript Eco System is moving to TypeScript. Fast. TypeScript has some unique, very powerful features that fit very well with the dynamic nature of the JavaScript language. This workshop will get you up and running with all the basics and the most important advanced patterns of TypeScript.<br/>
									<br/>
									But beyond that, this is a workshop for React devs! So we will discuss extensively how to combine TypeScript with a React code base. To practice the theory, during the hands-on parts of this workshop we will be migrating an application from plain JavaScript to TypeScript.
