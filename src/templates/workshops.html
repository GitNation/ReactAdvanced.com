Leverage React to build design tokens and a component library that can be used in products and can evolve as teams use it. At the end of the day, you will have a small but complete Design system implementation that will cover the full product lifecycle.</p>',

Not only React Native is changing mobile ecosystem nowadays, GraphQL is also an important part of how we connect to our backend.</p>
			<p class="schedule-list__p">We will go through GraphQL basics and use it in our Whatsapp app to connect to GraphQL endpoint which we will also define and create during workshop by using free and open source Hasura GraphQL engine. Workshop will give you the ultimate experience of creating React Native app from scratch with GraphQL API.</p>',

React may be just a simple UI library, but it involves a pretty big ecosystem around it. Explaining the basics and internals is not enough, so in this module we&apos;re going to explain the best practices, we&apos;re going to learn to "think in React", and apply solutions to real problems that you might encounter in the process of building an app.</p>
		<p class="schedule-list__p">We&apos;ll explore all the advanced techniques for making flexible and maintainable React components. We&apos;ll see how using popular patterns like Higher Order Components, Compound Components, Render Props etc. can help us in simplifying things, making our components more reusable and our apps more declarative.</p>
		<p class="schedule-list__p">React 16 comes with some major changes and an update to the core algorithm. In this module, we&apos;ll explore some practical use-cases for Hooks, Portals, Fragments, Error Boundaries etc. We&apos;ll see how the new Context API can simplify state-management and we&apos;ll play with a new feature called react-call-return.</p>',

Further we explore powerful concepts like pattern matching and Variants. Half way through we are going to write our first ReasonReact component.
